Invented a ranking system that re-ranks the search query results based on technical complexity of the documents.

* Predictive model uses a topological graph properties extracted from graph representation of text as input feature set.  
* Graph representation captures conceptual cohesion, conveying authorâ€™s intent.  
* Topological features captures cohesiveness, topic complexity and connectedness in constructing technicality score predictor.  
* Attained predicting accuracy of more than 96% over test queries results, indicating high reliability.  
* Patent pending for the above invention.
